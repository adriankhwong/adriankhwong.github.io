Hello there!

I have ideas and thoughts that seems a bit big to be in a Facebook post. This is one of many reasons why I always wanted to start a blog. In my blog, I intend to share my positive and negative life experiences, personal/career/leadership development, travel adventures, food recommendations/reviews, and random life tidbits. I can flow through life from one moment to the next [meaning I “you only live once” (YOLO) a lot]. My mission in life is

__*to work, volunteer, travel and eat across the globe to grow myself and others around me*__

Find out how I have been living my mission statement in my [resume](/resume) as well as take a look at what I am currently doing [now](/now).

**Fun facts**

1.	I can play the trumpet, though I’m quite rusty now
2.	I watched Hong Kong dramas for at least 4 to 5 hours a day for the first 18 years of my life
3.	I play farming games like Minions Paradise, The Simpsons Tap Out, and Futurama Worlds of Tomorrow. I play a lot and collect resources efficiently
4.	I dressed up in a maid outfit for an Anime Convention
5.	I participated in the a 5km obstacle race called SPARTAN Sprint Race in June 2015
6.	I do thorough research on places to eat before going to those places
7.	I started doing yoga at 6am in my bedroom during my internship in Japan
8.	Almost all my travel adventures to the US, Europe, and Asia have been fully or mostly subsidize due to work and volunteering
